/* =========================================================
   EXERCISE DETAILS — rich reference data (muscles, form, media) for the
   exercise detail screen. Deliberately kept SEPARATE from LIBRARY: this is
   reference/media metadata, not workout-logging data, so it can be extended

   PROOF OF CONCEPT — populated for 3 exercises only, as requested:
   Barbell Back Squat, Barbell Bench Press, Conventional Deadlift.

   IMPORTANT — animation_available is false for all of these. There is no
   real hosted video/CDN for this app; animation_webm_url / animation_mp4_url

   duration_seconds, rpe) — one row per SET. Verified against a real
   304-session / 4593-row export before writing this, per the "inspect
   before importing" rule: set_type values (normal/warmup/dropset/failure)
   map directly onto this app's own SET_TYPE_CYCLE, weight is already in kg,
   and rpe values already match this app's RPE_OPTIONS format.

   Distance/duration-based cardio sets (Treadmill etc.) are imported with
   blank weight/reps -- so they never corrupt volume or PR math -- with a
   note on the exercise flagging that distance/duration weren't preserved,
   since this app's set schema has no field for them (same honest gap as
   PRs/Race analytics elsewhere in this build).

   Additive only: existing workout history is never touched or replaced.
   Re-importing the same file is safe -- sessions already present (matched
   by title + exact start time) are skipped as duplicates, not re-added.
